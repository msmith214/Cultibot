<h2>About</h2>
Cultibot is an application for the social media platform Discord. It facilitates gameplay for the game Cultivate, an activity in the spirit of Tamogatchi or Neko Atsume where the player plants a seedling, guides its growth, and is challenged to see how tall the seedling can grow over a 24-hour period. Gameplay is accessed by slash commands, an integral part of Discord's API wherein users can interact with applications by typing commands such as "/help" directly into Discord's chat UI.

<h2>Commands</h2>
The following commands may be of use to you:</br>
<b>/plant</b> This command creates a new plant that belongs to the user, which grows once an hour over the course of 24 hours. The objective of Cultivate is to see how tall you can grow your plant. The plant's growth can be affected by using items on your plant. </br>
<b>/check</b> This command tells you how tall your plant is currently.</br>
<b>/rummage</b> This command allows you to acquire free items and currency to spend.</br>
<b>/shop</b> This command shows the shop UI.</br>
<b>/inv</b> This command shows your inventory of items.</br>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>
Plants "grow" once every "tick" (which happens at the top of every hour) for 24 hours. Plants normally grow by 1.25 inches every hour, but this rate can be increased by items purchased from the shop or obtained using the /rummage command (which sometimes yields quartz shards, the shop's currency, instead of items.)
Plants also belong to one of five types: Flower, Gourd, Veggie, Tuber, or Miscellaneous. It starts as a Miscellaneous plant and develops into a Flower, Gourd, Veggie, or Tuber if you interact with it predominantly by socializing, venting, encouraging, or complimenting it respectively.
